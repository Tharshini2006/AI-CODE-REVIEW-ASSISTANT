# AI Code Review Assistant

AI Code Review Assistant is a web-based application that analyzes source code and provides intelligent feedback to improve code quality. It helps developers identify errors, bad practices, and possible improvements using artificial intelligence.



## Overview

Manual code reviews are time-consuming and error-prone. This project automates the code review process by analyzing user-submitted code and generating meaningful suggestions. It is especially useful for students, beginners, and developers who want quick feedback while coding.



## Features

- Detects syntax and logical errors
- Provides AI-generated code suggestions
- Improves code readability and quality
- Fast and easy-to-use interface
- Helpful for learning and practice


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)  
- **AI Model:** OpenAI API  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code  

## How it works?

1. User enters the source code in the web interface.
2. Frontend sends the code to the backend using an API request.
3. Backend forwards the code to the AI model for analysis.
4. AI analyzes the code and generates review suggestions.
5. Results are sent back and displayed to the user.
